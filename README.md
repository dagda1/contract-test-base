## Solution

Base for all contract tests

## Install

You will need to install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

You should be running node 11 if possible, that is what I am running and I know node-sass will build on that version.

Once node npm is installed, run

```bash
 npm run doitall
```

## Build the solution

```bash
npm run build
```

## Run tests

The tests use jest.  I've not gone overboard with testing but just enough to show I can write js tests. I am fully versed in the world of js tests.

```bash
 npm test
```
